  <h1>About</h1>

  <h2>What is sens.legal?</h2>

  <p>
    sens.legal is a technology hub in alpha stage focused on the complete pipeline
    of professional legal practice in Brazil. It combines semantic search over real
    court data, a knowledge graph built on the FRBR ontology, anti-hallucination
    verification, and native LLM integration via Model Context Protocol (MCP).
  </p>

  <p>
    The platform is composed of three projects — <a href="/projects/valter">Valter</a>
    (legal knowledge backend), <a href="/projects/juca">Juca</a> (frontend for lawyers),
    and <a href="/projects/leci">Leci</a> (legislation backend) — designed to work
    together as an integrated ecosystem.
  </p>

  <h2>Who</h2>

  <p>
    sens.legal is created by <strong>Diego Sens</strong>, a software engineer building
    tools that make legal research, analysis, and argumentation accessible to both
    lawyers and LLMs.
  </p>

  <h2>Vision</h2>

  <p>
    Make the entire legal pipeline — research, analysis, argumentation, verification —
    accessible to lawyers and LLMs alike. Every claim traceable to real court data.
    Every argument backed by verified jurisprudence.
  </p>

  <h2>What makes it different</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Knowledge graph (FRBR ontology)</strong> — decisions, criteria, legal
      devices, precedents, and ministers are first-class entities connected by 207K+
      relationships. Not a keyword index over flat text.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>MCP-native</strong> — 28 tools exposed via Model Context Protocol,
      letting Claude and ChatGPT query jurisprudence, verify claims, and compose
      arguments directly. Not a chatbot wrapper.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Anti-hallucination</strong> — every claim returned by the system is
      verified against real court data. Citation chains are traced in the knowledge
      graph. No invented case numbers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Real STJ data</strong> — 28,000+ decisions, 810K+ metadata records,
      2,100+ classified features from the Superior Tribunal de Justica. Not synthetic
      or scraped-and-forgotten data.
    </li>
  </ul>
