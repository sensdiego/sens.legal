# Roadmap de Produto

## The roadmap defines strategic sequence, not implementation proof
Leci roadmap documents target outcomes and sequencing decisions. Code-level status must still be verified in repository artifacts.

## Roadmap vision
Leci is planned to evolve into a trustworthy legal retrieval platform with:
- structured legal data ingestion and normalization;
- search and reading product surfaces;
- auditable legal revision workflows;
- optional agent-facing integration layers.

## Priority model
Roadmap priorities follow `P0` to `P3`:
- `P0`: blocking and critical for delivery baseline
- `P1`: important for near-term product value
- `P2`: desirable medium-term enhancements
- `P3`: optional or long-term opportunities

## Risk-aware sequencing
Roadmap sequence should remain responsive to critical risk findings from premortem analysis, especially around:
- quality gates and testing;
- ingestion reliability;
- source-of-truth governance.
