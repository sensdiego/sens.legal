# Milestones

## Milestones translate strategy into executable chunks
Each milestone should define scope, dependencies, and a clear completion definition to avoid ambiguity in delivery status.

## v0.1 — Foundation API
Objective: convert DB-first foundation into product-usable interfaces and reproducible setup.

Expected scope:
- API/search baseline contracts
- onboarding and environment hardening
- command and docs alignment

## v0.2 — Product Beta
Objective: deliver first useful legal discovery UX and ingestion baseline.

Expected scope:
- user-facing search/browse/read flows
- initial ingestion path
- UI-to-data integration stabilization

## v0.3 — Governance and Quality
Objective: strengthen correctness, process governance, and confidence.

Expected scope:
- revision governance workflow
- test strategy expansion
- operational quality criteria

## v0.4 — Intelligence
Objective: add differentiation through advanced retrieval and integration patterns.

Expected scope:
- semantic/hybrid retrieval improvements
- conditionally approved integration surfaces

## v1.0 — Ecosystem
Objective: stabilize contracts and operations for broader multi-consumer adoption.

Expected scope:
- durable integration contracts
- operational hardening
- supportable release governance

## Sequencing caveat
Milestone ordering may change when critical risk mitigations require earlier investment in quality or reliability infrastructure.
