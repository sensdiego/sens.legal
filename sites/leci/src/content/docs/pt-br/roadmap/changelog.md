# Changelog do Roadmap

## This changelog preserves planning traceability
Roadmap updates should be logged to keep strategic shifts auditable and understandable over time.

## Entry format
Each changelog entry should include:
- date
- change summary
- rationale
- approver/owner
- impacted milestone(s)

## Initial baseline entry
- **2026-02-28** — Initial structured roadmap and risk mitigation sections established from technical diagnosis and premortem outputs.

## Future update policy
When priorities or milestone order changes, update this page in the same PR that modifies roadmap source artifacts.
