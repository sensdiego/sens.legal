# Artefato de Camada de Inovação

## Purpose of this artifact
This artifact documents strategic innovation proposals that could materially increase product value if sequenced correctly.

## Current innovation candidate
The current highlighted proposal is a temporal trust layer that combines:
- date-aware legal retrieval;
- verifiable evidence receipts;
- replayable trust semantics.

## Why this is not committed scope yet
Innovation proposals can create execution drag if introduced before core reliability. They should remain conditional on objective readiness criteria.

## Readiness requirements for promotion
Promote proposal to committed milestone scope only when:
- core API and data reliability are validated;
- demand signals are confirmed;
- quality and governance controls are in place.
