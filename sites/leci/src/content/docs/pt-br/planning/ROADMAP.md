# Artefato de Roadmap de Planejamento

## Purpose of this artifact
This planning document stores roadmap assumptions and milestone structure that feed the public-facing roadmap pages. It is intended as a working artifact for planning updates.

## Current strategic direction
The roadmap targets evolution from DB-first foundation to a trustworthy legal retrieval platform with:
- operational search API surfaces;
- richer user-facing legal exploration;
- ingestion reliability;
- governance and quality hardening.

## Milestone sequence summary
- `v0.1`: foundation API and setup reliability
- `v0.2`: product beta experience and ingestion baseline
- `v0.3`: governance and quality reinforcement
- `v0.4`: intelligence features and selective advanced integrations
- `v1.0`: ecosystem-level stability and contracts

## Priority model summary
Priorities use a practical risk/value model:
- P0 for blockers and core foundation;
- P1 for near-term product value;
- P2 for strategic medium-term differentiation;
- P3 for long-horizon opportunities.
