# Camada de Confiança Temporal

## This is a strategic proposal, not implemented functionality
The temporal trust layer is a proposed innovation to return legal text as valid at a specific date and pair answers with verifiable evidence artifacts.

> 🚧 **Planned Feature** — This feature is on the roadmap strategy layer but not yet implemented in current code.

## Proposed capability
The proposal combines:
- date-aware legal retrieval;
- diff visibility between historical and current legal text;
- evidence manifest and hash-based verification.

## Why it matters
If implemented well, this capability could shift product value from generic legal search to trustable legal evidence infrastructure.

## Preconditions before implementation
This proposal should be gated by:
- stable core API contracts;
- baseline operational SLOs;
- validated demand from pilot users.

## Key risks
Main risks include:
- historical legal source inconsistency;
- temporal modeling complexity;
- execution overhead before core product stability.

:::caution
Prioritize core reliability first. Shipping this layer too early can reduce trust if temporal outputs are inconsistent.
