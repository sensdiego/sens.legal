# Repository Reorganization Plan Artifact

## Purpose of this artifact
This plan captures structural cleanup recommendations that improve maintainability and documentation scalability without unnecessary refactor risk.

## Main recommendations captured
The plan emphasizes moderate, high-value adjustments:
- reduce root-level document sprawl;
- standardize environment and setup metadata;
- improve docs governance and source-of-truth clarity;
- avoid deep architecture refactors too early.

## Execution safeguards
Reorganization should preserve:
- migration compatibility;
- legal text revision invariants;
- contributor onboarding reliability.

## Current status
This artifact is a planning reference and should be updated when structure-level decisions are approved or superseded.
