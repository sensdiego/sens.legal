# Leci
> Leci is a Brazilian federal legislation platform focused on structured legal retrieval, revision traceability, and AI-ready consumption.

Important notes:
- The current implementation is database-first: schema, indexing, and revision audit are implemented, while API and ingestion layers are roadmap work.
- Legal text integrity is a hard invariant: never update `document_nodes.content_text` directly; use controlled revision flows.
